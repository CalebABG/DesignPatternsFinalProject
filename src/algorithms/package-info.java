/**
 * This package has two sub-packages: factories, sorting
 *
 * The factories package provides the interface for defining Factories for Sorting Algorithms, as well as providing
 * a baseline implementation factory which follows the Abstract Factory pattern.
 *
 * The sorting package provides the interface for defining what a Sorting Algorithm is, as well as providing
 * an abstract base class and 4 subsequent concrete implementations for sorting algorithms.
